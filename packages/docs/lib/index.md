# Schlechtenburg

Schlechtenburg is an experimental WYSIWYG editor framework made with Vue 3 and TypeScript. It takes cues from both Wordpress' Gutenberg editor and CKEditor, though it tries to become a best of both worlds; a very lightweight, easily extensible core, written with modern components and the accompanying state management.

It inputs and outputs a tree of JSON-serializable data.

Just a plaything for now.
